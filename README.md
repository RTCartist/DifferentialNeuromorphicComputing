How to use the code to perform visual differential perocessing:
1. Download and install the LTspice for the circuit simulation, and import the .sub file in the code/circuit folder.
2. Extracting video into single frames.
3. Convert the image into PWL voltages in simualtion using the code/CropPic.m PicCompression.m pwlgeneration_batch.m in sequence.
4. Check that the circuit code/circuit/visual627.asc is operational.
5. Run the code/simulation.py file.
6. Fianlly, the processed results can be extracted using the code/readtest.m file.

The dataset folder contains the dataset we use, and it is a Google Drive link as the dataset is too large.
